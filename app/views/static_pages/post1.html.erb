Today I have decided to resign from my job as a management consultant, leaving almost six figures and attractive benefits in the pursuit of learning, growing and being happy with my livelihood.  Some will see this as a bold move, others will understand.  I am tired of standing on the sidelines wearing an empty suit, pretending opportunity will come to me.  It is time to “make it happen!”.  It is time to learn, create, explore and do.
<br>
<br>
Empty Suit is about my journey throughout this pursuit to learn, create, explore and do.  My goal is to take everything I learn from web development and design and incorporate it back into this site, in addition to writing about the side projects I become involved with and the people I meet along the way.  I hope to use this blog as a means to capture my passions, my struggles and my victories.  Hopefully my story will be heard and inspire those also looking to “make it happen”.
